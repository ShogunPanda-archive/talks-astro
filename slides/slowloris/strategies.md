# Mitigation strategies

#### Distinguish between requests which are legit and requests that belong to the attack is very hard. **None of the strategies below is 100% accurate.**

<div class="columns flex flex-1 items-center">
  <Item icon="lock-access" title="Limit connections per IP">
    As the attack is distributed, the attacker can easily switch to another IP.
  </Item>


  <Item icon="hourglass" title="Enforce speed or time constraints">
    Itâ€™s hard to establish a connection which will not cut out slow legit clients.
  </Item>
</div>
